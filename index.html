        <h3>HTML Page</h3>
        <p>This was my first HTML website I developed. We used HTML tags, including header, section, footer and paragraphs to create the basic structure of the HTML5 document. Firstly, I created the index.html file on GitHub and using the learnings of the basic ideas behind the structure of a HTML document, this was the website I created using HTML and CSS styling to enhance content appearance.</p>

        <h3>HTML Website with CSS Styling</h3>
        <p> This project was built on the previous website, where we built on the foundational structure of HTML and CSS and started implementing more complicated CSS styling to the website. This is where I learned the idea of 'classes' and 'id'. Both these attributes are used to identify and style elements. Helping target specific elements when applying CSS styles or JavaScript functionality.
          Furthermore, we then applied aspects of the box model to ensure the position of our elements created om HTML were in the desired spots.</p>

        <h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
        <p>This website demonstrates event driven model using JSS, and was the first time using the DOM features to build a website. Following a certain pattern we used HTML, CSS and JS to create a basic rock paper scissors game, where we styled buttons and text to enhance the features and look of the game.</p>

        <h3>Flatland Project</h3>
        <p>The Flatland HTML website further demonstrated the event driven model using JavaScript. The purpose of this website is that if the user clicks on the square while hovering it will update the text, generating a random buzz word. Furthermore, when the user hovers over the square it will change colour. These two main functions were driven by JavaScript, and styled using CSS. </p>

        <h3>To-Do List</h3>
        <p>The To Do List website demonstrates local storage which works in conjunction with user input from the buttons. The inputs interact with JavaScript to update the webpage and store the local data on the server. We used the DOM application the plan the basics, which then resulted in a simple list of use cases that we may want to include in our To Do List Website (Add checkboxes, database, simple list item, add a form, add style). The user can add a task to the list, then click on the checkbox to mark it as completed. Using the buttons, the user can see "All" tasks, "Active" tasks, and "Completed" tasks. </p>

        <h3>RSS Feeder</h3>
        <p>The RSS feeder was the website that included an XHR Request. We created an XHR object, write an event listener, and then open and send.  The website's purpose is to feed the website an RSS link, and it will list all the RSS feeds on a page. Including the title, publication date, author, link and content. </p>

    <h2>My Reflection on the Website</h2>
    <p>Building this website portfolio was very fulfilling, allowing me to showcase the skills and projects that I have developed over the last 6 weeks.  I had to adapt to new technologies and enhance my skill set to ensure this portfolio was created effectively.  As I went through the processes, I faced various challenges, and learned valuable lessons, overall creating an engaging and visually appealing portfolio. </p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <p> <b>1. Content Creation and Organisation </b> - Deciding what content to include within the website, and how to structure it proved to be quite a daunting task. I wanted to showcase a range of projects while making it easy to navigate for the user and remaining concise.  To be concise, while showing your skills was quite the challenge. </p>
      <p> <b>2. Design </b> - Crafting a visually appealing design was essential for me, and I struggled to come up with some ideas. Selecting the right way to display the text, colour scheme, and layout provided to be quite time-consuming. </p>
    <h3>Overcoming the Challenges</h3>
      <p>1. For content creation and organisation, I opted for a minimalist approach. This was in the form of a one-page website, that contained a grid-like portfolio of my websites. I also used an approach of planning my idea, carrying it out, then going back to see how I can improve. This helped me develop a clear understanding of my content creation, allowing me to see what the idea looked like after being implemented.</p>
      <p>2. To tackle design and aesthetics, I looked through various website designs and trends and sought inspiration from other portfolios. After various iterations, I finally settled on a one-page layout as it enable the user to scroll through my page efficiently while covering everything that I required. Providing a visually engaging experience for the visitors.</p>
    <h3>My Successes</h3>
      <p>Building my website portfolio was a challenging yet rewarding experience. I had many successes throughout the build providing me with invaluable experience to enhance and showcase my skills. By overcoming the initial challenges, I was able to effectively build a website that showcases all my projects. </p>
