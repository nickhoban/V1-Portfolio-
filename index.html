        I have attained a Bachelors degree in Business Information Technology and Systems Double Major (BCom). Throughout my academic career, I have gained hands-on experience on a variety of IT projects such as software development, database management, and system implementation, which built on my programming, data analysis, and project management experience. My skills include over three years of working in the healthcare industry on large- scale projects. I have been responsible for planning, managing, operating, and developing multiple businesses. Furthermore, my keen ability to maintain client relationships and overlook operational problems has resulted in long-lasting relationships for our company. I am proud of my solid track record when delivering projects, and I have received outstanding feedback for my skills to organize, communicate and strategically deliver projects.

        <h3>HTML Page</h3>
        <p>This was my first HTML website I developed. We used HTML tags, including header, section, footer and paragraphs to create the basic structure of the HTML5 document. Firstly, I created the index.html file on GitHub and using the learnings of the basic ideas behind the structure of a HTML document, this was the website I created using HTML and CSS styling to enhance content appearance.</p>

        <h3>HTML Website with CSS Styling</h3>
        <p> This project built on the previous website, where we built on the foundational structure of HTML and CSS and started implementing more complicated CSS styling to the website. This is were I learned the idea of 'classes' and 'id'. Both these attributes are used to identify and style elements. Helping target specific elements when applying CSS styles or JavaScript functionality.
          Furthermore, we then applied aspects of the box model to ensure the position of our elements created om HTML were in the desired spots.</p>

        <h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
        <p>This website demonstrates  event driven model using JSS, and was the first time using the DOM features to build a website. Following a certain pattern we used HTML, CSS and JS to create a basic rock paper scissors game, where we styled buttons and text to enhance the features and look of the game.</p>

        <h3>Flatland Project</h3>
        <p>The Flatland HTML website further demonstrated the event driven model using JavaScript. The purpose of this website is that if the user clicks on the square while hovering it will update the text, generating a random buzz word. Furthermore, when the user hovers over the square it will change colour. Theses two main functions were driven by JavaScript, and styled using CSS. </p>

        <h3>To-Do List</h3>
        <p>The To Do List website demonstrates local storage which works in conjunction with user input from the buttons. The inputs interact with the JavaScript to update the webpage and store the local data on the server. We used the DOM application the plan the basics, which then resulted in a simple list of use cases that we may want to include in our To Do List Website (Add checkboxes, database, simple list item, add a form, add style). The user can add a task to the list, then click on the checkbox to mark it as completed. Using the buttons, the user can see "All" tasks, "Active" tasks, and "Completed" task. </p>

        <h3>RSS Feeder</h3>
        <p>The RSS feeder was the website that included an XHR Request. We created an XHR object, write an event listener, and then open and send.  The websites purpose is to feed the website an RSS link, and it will list all the RSS feeds in a page. Including the title, publication date, author, link and content. </p>
